    <p>Hey guys! My reason for doing all this is simple. I just thought that even I could be of some help during this pandemic.
        And so, I created this website for free books (because we have all these online classes... 😁).
    </p>
    <p>
        And so... 9 files later, I got this. And... well... it's not that good. And that's why there is that feedback link up there 👆🏻.
        I am open to all suggestions and will try my best to implement them. Unless your suggestions are like "delete all your files".
        So... ya. Enjoy!<br><br>
